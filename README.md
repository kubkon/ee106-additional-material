## Introduction
In this repo, you can find several coding examples I have used while teaching first-year programming course using Python 3 at University of Strathclyde.

## Contents
The repo currently consists of the following examples:

1.  rps - sample implementation of 'rock-paper-scissors' game built step-by-step. This
    folder also consists of scripts demonstrating the idea and importance of unit testing,
    and the usefulness of the Python 3 standard library.

2.  sorting - sample implementation of different sorting algorithms, and their comparison
    in terms of time of execution.
